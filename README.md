# phonenumber
In this project a root window will pop up ,and then we can save the phone number in our contact.
I will recommend you to use this code in jupyter notebook,and upload the image ana.png in the jupyter notebook,then after executing this 
code one pop window will bw shown where you can add phone numbers in the contact list.it was the first mini project i made.
